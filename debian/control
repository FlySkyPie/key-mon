Description: Screencast utility that displays your keyboard and mouse status
 Key-mon is useful for teaching since it shows the current status of your
 keyboard and mouse and you use them in another application.
 .
 No longer do you need to say 'Now I'm pressing the Ctrl-D key', your students
 can just see the keystroke for themselves.
